TODO:

### Solve power loss issue ###
Currently, when a digital switch is flipped there is a chance power loss occurs, causing the game to be reset with a different question being presented on screen. This occurs when connected to a computer via USB or to a wall socket via an Apple iPhone wall wort.

### Handle two basic states ###
There should be distinct states which separate gameplay from the "score" screen at the end indicating success or failure. Switching from the score screen back to gameplay should reset the game and display a new question.

### Improve game timer###
The game timer should be displayed in the lower or upper right of the screen and ideally should be counting down from 20 instead of up.

### Reduce or eliminate the reliance on arrays and loops ###
Once full functionality is achieved the usage of arrays and loops should be replaced with integers and bitwise operations to store and manipulate the binary numbers. A function that converts from decimal to binary for display purposes is also necessary.

### Add more question types ###
Right now the game consists of AND and OR operations but my original intention for this game was to test bitmasking knowledge.

### Edit and publish current documentation ###
I have a few pages documenting my progress from the beginning, as well as photos of the breadboard prototype that I would like to clean up and present here.
